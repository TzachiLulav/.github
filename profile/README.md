# CITROS
CITROS was developed by [lulav space](https://lulav.space) to automate robotic simulation and testing processes and integrate them with DevOps pipelines to achieve an end-to-end software validation process without any human intervention.

As space engineers who already crashed one lander on the moon (the Beresheet mission) and are now participating in our second lunar landing mission, we know how optimizing and automating the validation process of software can be the difference between failure and success.

Our mission is to enable robotics engineers to develop robotics to the highest standards, just as in space, and to do so faster than ever before.
